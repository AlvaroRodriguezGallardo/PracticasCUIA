**Note**: ``camara.py`` contains data about the webcam calibration. I could get it thanks to my teacher, [Antonio Bautista Bailón Morillas](https://www.ugr.es/personal/antonio-bautista-bailon-morillas).

## Description

This is a project which merges augmented reality, multimodal interaction and natural language processing. The theme is a basic and interactive learning application of the Solar System. You need to run the program, and it will start two process: the main process who runs all about the frame that the webcam gets, and the second one, who is continuosly listening to the user, communicating with the main process, which will alter the program's behavior if it encounters one of the keywords (they communicate through a queue, FIFO philosophy).
